# ThesisPlots

Plotting utilities and example scripts used to produce figures for a thesis or
reports. The folder contains subfolders such as `MSW/` and `Oscillations/` with
scripts that generate publication-style plots.

Before running these scripts ensure you have the required data and headers in
place. Many plotting scripts expect the `Headers` utilities to be importable.
