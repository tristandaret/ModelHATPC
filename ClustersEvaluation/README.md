# ClustersEvaluation

Contains scripts used to evaluate cluster responses and produce diagnostic
plots. Typical scripts:
- `PointNColumns.py` - compare point-like deposits across column geometries.
- `Ratio_Diag_HC.py` - compute ratios used in diagnostic plots.
- `SignalPointOverlayWF.py`, `SignalTrackClusterWF*.py` - overlay waveform
  visualizations for clusters and tracks.

These analysis scripts rely on the `Headers` helpers and the model functions in
`Headers/ModelUtils.py`.
